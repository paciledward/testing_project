- I have gained valuable insights and skills that have deepened my understanding of the software development process. Initially, my perception of testing was limited to merely finding bugs; however, I now recognize that testing is a critical component of ensuring software quality and user satisfaction.
I also discovered the significance of creating both positive and negative test cases. This means not only checking if the software works as intended but also testing how it handles unexpected situations. This approach enhances the overall user experience.
